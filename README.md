📊 Key Findings

Aircrafts operating under VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions) are statistically safer.

Low accident frequency is a strong indicator of mechanical integrity and proper maintenance.

Zero-fatality models demonstrate superior safety features and pilot adaptability.

The aircraft model evaluated (ULTR) shows exceptionally low operational risk.
